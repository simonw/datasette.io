# Using Datasette in GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a free tool from GitHub that gives you a full Linux development environment running in the cloud, accessed entirely through your browser.

It's a really neat way to get started with Datasette, in particular as a tool to build your own private Datasette instance and start using it to explore and analyze data.

Please note that Codespaces is not designed to host public websites. Any Datasette instances you create within a Codespace will only be accessible as private instances for your personal use.

This tutorial will show how to install and run Datasette in a Codespaces environment.

## Step 1: Create a Codespace

Each Codespace needs to be attached to a GitHub repository.

You can use any of your existing repositories, or create a brand new one.

Or if you don't want to create your own repository you can use my [simonw/codespaces-datasette](https://github.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette) repository instead.

Use the "Code" button, select the "Codespaces" tab and then click "Create codespace on main" to start a new codespace.
{% endmarkdown %}

{% markdown %}

After a short delay while the codespace starts running you should see an interface that looks like this:

![Screenshot of the Codespaces main interface - it has three panels, with the most interesting being the terminal interface at the bottom of the page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette/main/codespaces-ui.jpg)

We will be working exclusively in the Terminal panel at the bottom of the page.

## Step 2: Install Datasette

Before we can run Datasette, we need to install it. We can do that using the following command:

    pipx install datasette

This will install Datasette using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which ensures it is kept in its own separate environment where it can't clash with any other Python code you may decide to run in your codespace.

To confirm that Datasette has installed successfully, run this:

    datasette --version

We also need to install a plugin:

    datasette install datasette-codespaces

The [datasette-codespaces](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-codespaces) plugin makes some small changes to Datasette to better run in the Codespaces environment. You can run Datasette without it but you may run into some frustrating issues, such as internal links not working correctly.

## Step 3: Start Datasette

To start Datasette, run this command:

    datasette data.db --create

This will start Datasette running against an empty SQLite database called `data.db`. If that database does not exist yet it will be created.

You should see the following:

![The terminal window shows Datasette outputting some INFO: log lines. A dialog is shown next to it which reads: Your applicaiton running on port 8001 is available - it provides a big green Open in Browser button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette/main/start-datasette.jpg)

Click that "Open in Browser" button to open the Datasette web interface in a new browser tab.

If you can't see that button, check to see if the "Ports" tab is available in the Codespaces interface. You can use that to connect to your Datasette instance instead.

## Step 4: Import some data

Your Datasette interface will start with an empty database. Let's add some data to it!

We'll do that using the [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/) command line tool.

We can leave Datasette running in the background by starting a new terminal. Click on the word "python" at the top of the terminal window and select "Split terminal":

![Clicking Python reviels a menu with several options - the top one is called Split Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette/main/split-terminal.jpg)

You should now have two terminal windows next to each other.

In the new terminal window, run this command to install sqlite-utils:

    pipx install sqlite-utils

Then confirm installation with:

    sqlite-utils --version

![Screenshot of two terminal windows - the left one contains Datasette, while the right one shows a freshly installed copy of sqlite-utils.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette/main/two-terminals.jpg)

Let's fetch a CSV file from the web:
{% endmarkdown %}
<p><code>wget https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2022/Manatee_Carcass_Recovery_Locations_in_Florida.csv</code></p>
<p>And insert it into our database:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils insert data.db locations \
    Manatee_Carcass_Recovery_Locations_in_Florida.csv \
    --csv -d</code></pre>
    {% markdown %}
This creates a new table called `locations` containing the data from that CSV file - manatee carcass recovery locations in Florida dating back to 1974.

The `--csv` option tells sqlite-utils to treat the file as a CSV file, and the `-d` option tells it to infer the column types from the data (rather than treating every column as a text column).

See the tutorial [Cleaning data with sqlite-utils and Datasette](https://datasette.io/tutorials/clean-data) for more about this example data.

## Step 5: Install some more plugins

Datasette has over 100 available plugins, listed in the [plugins directory](https://datasette.io/plugins).

To install these, we first need to stop the Datasette server running. To do this first click back on the terminal window running Datasette and then hit `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

The `datasette install ...` command installs new plugins. Let's install a few of them:
{% endmarkdown %}
<pre><code>datasette install \
  datasette-vega \
  datasette-cluster-map \
  datasette-copyable \
  datasette-configure-fts \
  datasette-edit-schema \
  datasette-upload-csvs
</code></pre>
{% markdown %}
Here's what each of these plugins does:

- [datasette-vega](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega) adds line, bar and scatter chart visualizations
- [datasette-cluster-map](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map) adds a map visualization for any table with latitude and longitude columns
- [datasette-copyable](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-copyable) provides additional export options for copying and pasting data out of Datasette
- [datasette-configure-fts](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-configure-fts) helps you to configure full-text search for your tables
- [datasette-edit-schema](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-edit-schema) provides tools to edit the schema of your tables

Start the server running again like this:
```
datasette data.db
```
We don't need the `--create` option any more as we know the database already exists - although it won't break anything if we do include it.

## Step 6: Explore those manatee locations on a map

In Datasette, navigate to that "locations" table. It should have columns called X and Y which look like they might contain latitude and longitude data.

The `datasette-cluster-map` plugin can render these all on a map... but only if the columns have the names `latitude` and `longitude`.

We can use the `datasette-edit-schema` plugin to rename those columns.

Click on the cog icon at the top of the table, then select "Edit table schema".

{% endmarkdown %}
<img style="max-width: min(100%, 600px)" alt="Screenshot of the Edit table data/locations screen, with a list of columns that can be changed. The first two have been renamed to longitude and latitude." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/codespaces-datasette/main/rename-columns.jpg">
{% markdown extra_attrs="a:name,href" %}

Rename the `X` and `Y` columns to `longitude` and `latitude` respectively, then click "Apply changes".

Return to the table page and you should see this map of Florida with manatee locations plotted on it:
